# 19.3.0 - Title Pending

## Dual Wielding

Any one-handed weapon can be equipped in the offhand slot when the mainhand already holds a one-handed weapon.

This activates Dual Wield:

- Automatically triggers a free **follow-up offhand attack** after every mainhand attack
- Applies a **fatigue and hit chance penalty** based on the offhand weapon's weight
- Grants the **Double Swing** active skill (an AoE attack hitting up to 3 adjacent tiles, using both weapons)

## Favoured enemy rework

Perks were condensed into a few:
Favoured Enemy - Beasts
Favoured Enemy - Occult
Favoured Enemy - Greenskin
Favoured Enemy - Undead
Favoured Enemy - Civilization
Favoured Enemy - Outlaw
Favoured Enemy - Sword Master

- Orc Tyrant - elite orc warlord, his warcry can cascade on other warlords
