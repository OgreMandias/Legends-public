# 19.3.0 - Title Pending

## Dual Wielding

Any one-handed weapon can be equipped in the offhand slot when the mainhand already holds a one-handed weapon.

This activates Dual Wield:

- Automatically triggers a free **follow-up offhand attack** after every mainhand attack
- Applies a **fatigue and hit chance penalty** based on the offhand weapon's weight
- Grants the **Double Swing** active skill (an AoE attack hitting up to 3 adjacent tiles, using both weapons)

## Traits
- Hesitant now acts last in turn order
- Impatient acts first in turn order but cannot wait and loses 10% of melee defense
> Both of the above can still be manipulated by effects like adrenaline, the exact math is that Adrenaline increases turn order number by 2000, Hesitant and Impatient subtract/add 1000 respectively
> A character with Adrenaline and Hesitant will act before every other character but will act after a character with Adrenaline who does not have Hesitant
> A character with Impatient will act before everyone else but will act after a character with Adrenaline unless they also have Adrenaline, in which case they will always be first
- Greedy will now increase wage by 25% but also gain 1 to every attribute for every 10 gold paid in wages
- Eagle Eyes now increases vision by 2

## Perks

### Specialist Perks
- spec perks are now disabled from this version onwards
- because recent legends perk work focused on making a lot more recruits viable and interesting to play we decided that spec perks aren't as worthwhile anymore
- they also pigeonhole players into certain builds and make lowborn backgrounds disproportionately better than expensive recruits
- they're still in legends so we don't break compatibility and some of their effects will make their way on other perks
- you also might see it in a submod ;)

### Favoured enemy rework

Perks were condensed into a few:
Favoured Enemy - Beasts
Favoured Enemy - Occult
Favoured Enemy - Greenskin

Item refactors:

```

Added a new way of defining outfit variants: for example [1, "vanity/legend_helmet_southern_noble_crown", [1,2,3]], where variants can be now defined as an array.

A number of armor name refactors and normalization to use the same value in the name field and the .pngs, removing the brush field and separating
items that used the same brush name into standalone definitions. Note that items marked as 'separated' have their variant numbering restarted from 1.
The .pngs have also gone necessary changes, see the link below for more details (includes removal of bust_ prefix).
For clarity, legend_armor is prefixed at make_legends_armor level and should be referenced as such while building outfits.
Description changes for both armors and helmets.
Added named helmet bases support.
Refactored vanity_lower -> vanity in outfits and lowervanity defs field to lower.
Lower layers are now available for helms and masks.
The display ordering is as follows:
VanityLower -> VanityLower2 -> Head -> Helmet -> HelmLower -> TopLower -> Helm -> Top -> Vanity -> Vanity2
