You look through him, in both a literal and figurative sense — despite being unable to show emotion, he shifts uneasily. Your attention draws back to the page.\n %SPEECH_ON%Your orders are as follows:\n Strike anywhere infrastructure presents itself.\n Find and destroy patrols where the risk is low.\n Wear the armour of your enemies to sow confusion.\n\n We will be expecting news of your success soon, we assume you have not already engaged the enemy.\n\n Glory to the Emperor. %SPEECH_OFF% The screams come back into focus once again. The pyres are burning higher into the sky as more chairs, tables and bodies are added. Some are still alive, weeping and frozen in fear as you pass by. The messenger primes a quill and paper, ready to take a message back.\n\n You kneel at the fire, a distant feeling of warmth is expected, but does not materialise. Hacking at a burnt body, you take the child's arm — blistered and marked by the fire, and wrap it in the original letter as a butcher would do for meat. The messenger seems to understand, and makes their journey back to the north.\n You need everyone to see this — and they will.",
